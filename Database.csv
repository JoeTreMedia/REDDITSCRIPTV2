873215,teachers what type of student do you enjoy teaching the most what type do you hate I teach English to high school students in Korea I really like kids that try and put in effort it doesn't matter if they are good or not as long as they try I appreciate it and am willing to help them out then there are also the clowns of the class it's hard not to like them some of them are smart and do a good job While others aren't as motivated I suppose it's hard not to like them because they are able to get the class to laugh and make it more enjoyable for everyone the students I don't like are the ones who always fall asleep or never put in any effort after becoming a teacher I've realized how hard it is to stay awake during class after lunch so I don't mind when kids doze off because then I am able to wake them up in entertaining ways it's the kids who fall asleep no matter what time of day that annoy me because it requires me to either constantly wake them up or make sure they're doing what they need to do all of which ends up wasting class time since there is a slight language barrier between me and the kids my Korean isn't very good I will randomly make faces to the kids and then pretend nothing happened as a way to not only confuse them but to get them to pay attention to me as they will then want to try and see me do it again,1340
2341626,why do some homeless people prefer cash over food when offered if you give me food I will take it graciously tell you I'm going to eat it back at my hidden shelter thank you and then walk away when out of sight that food goes straight in the bin why because I don't know if you've tampered with it even if the container is sealed I still can't be sure you've not done anything to it people think it's funny to buy a Happy Meal spit in the burger rewrap it and give it to a homeless person even better they piss in the lemonade and hand it over yep really funny many charitable people have come up to me with Cups of Tea and were incredibly annoyed when I firmly told them to move away from me immediately in this particular case it wasn't because of the tampering thing it's because I'm extremely allergic to tea however if you offer to buy me food I would politely ask to come with you to see what's on the menu I have zero problems accepting food of any kind if I'm there when you purchase it most people wouldn't do this though so I just accepted whatever food I was given and later threw it away or spent any money they gave me on food myself I've had my food tampered with and I got sick as a result being sick when your homeless can be deadly what might give you a stomach ache could easily kill us my health will always come first and if that offends your delicate sensibilities I couldn't care less you might know the food you're giving me is perfectly fine I don't I prefer money as my health always comes before your charity,1534

1721700,"people who are no longer bound by ndas what company Secrets can you expose I worked for a big- Time insurance company and our specific job instructions were to make sure that people got paid the lowest amount possible for example if your toaster broke and you contacted us explaining that your toaster broke we would find a $3 toaster from Walmart and pay you $3 if you specified the brand name we'd find the cheapest toaster from that brand and pay you that amount even if you specified your toaster price we had the legal right to knock the price down by 20% so even if you mentioned toaster $25 we'd pay you $20 the only way to get around this would be to specify every single thing about the toaster because we are legally obliged to find you a product that matches the entire description provided so if you mention Proctor syx 42888 two slice toaster from Walmart $25 will pay you $25 my company was once scammed like this by an old dude whose camera broke it was a cheap projector but it could somehow record in a crazy high resolution the cheapest camera on the market that matched his resolution was worth 30 grand and since he specified the resolution he got $3,000 for a projector worth less than $100",1211
5850960,when did you lose your faith in humanity when I was in high school I was really fond of our English teacher she was really nice to everyone even the troublemakers who were treated as outcasts by the rest of the school that's why I was shocked when she suddenly began speaking less and less I could see dark circles under her eyes and it was clear that she was going through a rough time one day out of nowhere she showed up to school with her head completely shaved everyone immediately started making cancer jokes because it was clear she didn't actually have cancer someone then spread a rumor that she was transitioning and wanted to become trans I was appalled this person had treated everyone equally and with kindness but now they were hellbent on making fun of her instead of helping her I tried being different but she told me that I shouldn't concern myself with her and refused to talk eventually most of the school was bullying and insulting her at every chance they got then one fateful day she came into class with a happy look on her face she told us she had shaved her head to support her husband who had terminal cancer and now that he passed away she didn't have any reason to stay in this town anymore and was leaving the school her last words to the students who bullied her were I hope you all succeed in life,1329
2341626,why do some homeless people prefer cash over food when offered if you give me food I will take it graciously tell you I'm going to eat it back at my hidden shelter thank you and then walk away when out of sight that food goes straight in the bin why because I don't know if you've tampered with it even if the container is sealed I still can't be sure you've not done anything to it people think it's funny to buy a Happy Meal spit in the burger rewrap it and give it to a homeless person even better they piss in the lemonade and hand it over yep really funny many charitable people have come up to me with Cups of Tea and were incredibly annoyed when I firmly told them to move away from me immediately in this particular case it wasn't because of the tampering thing it's because I'm extremely allergic to tea however if you offer to buy me food I would politely ask to come with you to see what's on the menu I have zero problems accepting food of any kind if I'm there when you purchase it most people wouldn't do this though so I just accepted whatever food I was given and later threw it away or spent any money they gave me on food myself I've had my food tampered with and I got sick as a result being sick when your homeless can be deadly what might give you a stomach ache could easily kill us my health will always come first and if that offends your delicate sensibilities I couldn't care less you might know the food you're giving me is perfectly fine I don't I prefer money as my health always comes before your charity,1534
